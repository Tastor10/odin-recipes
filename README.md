# odin-recipes
top-recipes-html-project.
This project is about making a web page of recipes in html, doing it with all the previous lessons of top completed.
I considered that the images should be in jpg format, since that format is good for photos (in this case, of food), and they should also be housed in a folder dedicated to them (images) for a better separation of the things.
I also considered that when writing the ingredients and recipes of each meal, it is good to highlight in bold the steps such as mixing, heating, etc. and the amount of things to place, such as 2 tablespoons of sugar among other things. The latter since the person who is seeing the recipe will be able to see more easily the most important thing of what they are reading.
I used: Unordered and Ordered Lists, Images, Relative Links, Strong and Em attributes.
